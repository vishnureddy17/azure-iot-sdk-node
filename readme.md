This branch adds support for custom token scopes for AAD auth on the service side. Originally, this was to support US Government cloud. However, this ended up not being necessary. However, I'm still keeping the branch around in case there is a use case for custom token scopes in the future.

The main changes are in 7322edd1cfc5d38eff85f92592c2da4ab788f133
